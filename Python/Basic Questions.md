Basic Questions
What is Django ORM?
Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a way to interact with the database using Python code instead of SQL.
How do you define a model in Django?
By creating a class that inherits from django.db.models.Model.
What are model fields in Django?
Attributes of a model class that define the type of data to be stored (e.g., CharField, IntegerField).
How do you create a one-to-one relationship in Django?
Using OneToOneField.
How do you create a many-to-many relationship in Django?
Using ManyToManyField.
Intermediate Questions
What is a QuerySet in Django?
A collection of database queries to retrieve objects from the database.
How do you filter QuerySets in Django?
Using methods like filter(), exclude(), and get().
What is the difference between filter() and get()?
filter() returns a QuerySet, while get() returns a single object and raises an exception if no match is found.
How do you perform a case-insensitive search in Django?
Using the iexact lookup.
What is the purpose of select_related and prefetch_related?
To optimize database queries by reducing the number of queries made.
Advanced Questions
How do you perform raw SQL queries in Django?
Using the raw() method on a model’s manager.
What are Django migrations?
A way to propagate changes made to models into the database schema.
How do you create custom model managers in Django?
By inheriting from models.Manager and adding custom methods.
What is the difference between save() and save(force_insert=True)?
save() updates an existing record or creates a new one, while save(force_insert=True) forces the creation of a new record.
How do you use Q objects for complex queries?
By combining multiple conditions using & (AND) and | (OR) operators.
Practical Questions
How do you update multiple records in Django?
Using the update() method on a QuerySet.
How do you delete records in Django?
Using the delete() method on a QuerySet or model instance.
What is the purpose of F expressions in Django?
To perform database operations involving model fields without fetching data into Python.
How do you perform aggregation in Django?
Using the aggregate() method with functions like Sum, Avg, Count.
How do you annotate QuerySets in Django?
Using the annotate() method to add calculated fields to QuerySets.
Conceptual Questions
What is the difference between ForeignKey and OneToOneField?
ForeignKey creates a many-to-one relationship, while OneToOneField creates a one-to-one relationship.
How do you handle database transactions in Django?
Using the transaction module to ensure atomicity.
What are proxy models in Django?
Models that use another model’s table but can add custom behavior.
How do you create a custom database backend in Django?
By subclassing BaseDatabaseWrapper and implementing required methods.
What is the purpose of Meta class in Django models?
To define model-specific options like ordering, unique constraints, and table name.
Performance Questions
How do you optimize database queries in Django?
Using select_related, prefetch_related, and indexing.
What are database indexes and how do you create them in Django?
Indexes improve query performance, created using index_together or indexes in the Meta class.
How do you handle large datasets in Django?
Using pagination and efficient querying techniques.
What is the purpose of bulk_create in Django?
To insert multiple records into the database in a single query.
How do you use database views in Django?
By creating unmanaged models that map to database views.
Miscellaneous Questions
How do you handle database migrations in a team environment?
Using version control and migration tools like makemigrations and migrate.
What is the purpose of db_index in Django fields?
To create an index on a field for faster lookups.
How do you perform database schema migrations in Django?
Using the makemigrations and migrate commands.
What are the different types of relationships in Django ORM?
One-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many.
How do you create a custom model field in Django?
By subclassing models.Field and implementing required methods.
Advanced ORM Features
What is the purpose of defer() and only() in QuerySets?
To control which fields are loaded from the database.
How do you use Subquery and OuterRef in Django?
For complex queries involving subqueries.
What is the purpose of Case and When in Django ORM?
To perform conditional expressions in queries.
How do you handle database constraints in Django?
Using unique_together, constraints, and CheckConstraint.
What are the different ways to join tables in Django ORM?
Using select_related, prefetch_related, and raw SQL.
Real-world Scenarios
How do you implement soft delete in Django?
By overriding the delete() method to mark records as deleted instead of removing them.
How do you handle database sharding in Django?
Using custom database routers and multiple database configurations.
What is the purpose of get_or_create in Django?
To retrieve an object if it exists, or create it if it doesn’t.
How do you handle database migrations for large tables in Django?
Using techniques like splitting migrations and running them in batches.
How do you use F expressions for field-to-field comparisons?
To compare and update fields within the same model instance.
Best Practices
How do you ensure data integrity in Django models?
Using constraints, validators, and database transactions.
What are the best practices for writing Django models?
Keeping models simple, using appropriate field types, and optimizing queries.
How do you handle circular imports in Django models?
Using import statements within methods or functions instead of at the top of the file.
How do you manage database connections in Django?
Using connection pooling and the close_old_connections method.
What are the common pitfalls to avoid when using Django ORM?
Avoiding N+1 queries, using efficient querying techniques, and properly indexing fields.
